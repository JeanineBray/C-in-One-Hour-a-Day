      3: {
      4: int x = 8;
      5: int y = 6;
      6: std::cout << std::endl;
      7: std::cout << x - y << " " << x * y << " " << x + y;
      8: std::cout << std::endl;
      9: return 0;
      10: }

2. Type in the program from Exercise 1 and then compile and link it. What does it do? Does it do what you guessed?

      3: {
